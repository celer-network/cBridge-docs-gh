# State Guardian Network

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (87).png>)

The Celer State Guardian Network (SGN) has been an essential part of Celer Network’s architecture. In Celer’s layer-2 scaling architecture, the SGN is a **specialized** Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain that serves the purposes of monitoring L1 transactions related to L2 state and faithfully passing layer-2 information back to layer-1 when needed.&#x20;

In the [Celer State Channel](https://www.celer.network/celercore/sgn/guardian.html), the SGN helps store channel states and respond to malicious settlements on L1 when needed. In the Celer [layer2.finance rollup chain](https://blog.celer.network/2021/02/18/layer2-finance-get-defi-mass-adoption-today-scaling-layer-1-defi-in-place-with-zero-migration/), the SGN extends as a decentralized block producer network to pass call data and state roots back to the L1 blockchain and submit fraud-proof from any SGN node even when the entire PoS consensus fails.&#x20;

CELR holders can stake their tokens into the SGN by becoming a validator or through delegation and actively provide the above-mentioned services. SGN participants receive staking rewards as well as fees in exchange for the services they help provide.&#x20;
