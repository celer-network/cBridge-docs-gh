# SGN V1 Unbonding Guide

## Withdraw Your Stakes From SGN V1

To withdraw your stakes, you need to first unbond your stakes from the delegator. The unbonding confirmation takes no time. Once stakes are unbonded, they can be withdrawn.

### Unbond Your Stakes

1. To unbond your stakes from a validator, go to "Validators", find the address you delegated to and click on it.
