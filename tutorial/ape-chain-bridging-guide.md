### Other Mobile Wallets

If you are using other mobile wallets, you try similar steps to adjust the gas price to 0 GWEI on Ape Chain. However, some mobile wallets may not allow 0 GWEI gas price (e.g., imToken). In this case, please use Metamask mobile or Metamask web extension to send bridge transactions on Ape Chain.
