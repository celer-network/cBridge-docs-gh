# 👋 Welcome to cBridge

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (52).png>)

cBridge introduces the best-in-class cross-chain token bridging experience with deep liquidity for users, highly efficient and easy-to-use liquidity management for both cBridge node operators and Liquidity Providers who do not want to operate cBridge nodes, and new exciting developer-oriented features such as general message bridging for cases like cross-chain DEX and NFTs. All of the above is made possible by extending the existing functionality and services provided by the Celer State Guardian Network (SGN) powered by validators and stakers in the system with value capture.
