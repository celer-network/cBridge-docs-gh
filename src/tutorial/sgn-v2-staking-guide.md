# SGN V2 Staking Guide

Staking your CELR with the Celer SGN allows you to gain transaction fee earnings and staking rewards. In this part, we will guide you through the process of delegating stakes to validators, withdrawing your stakes from the SGN, and managing your SGN rewards.&#x20;

## Delegate Stakes to Validators

1. First, connect your wallet to the Celer SGN and then switch to Ethereum Mainnet.

### Claim Transaction Fees from cBridge

When you stake CELR on SGN, in addition to staking rewards, you can also get cross-chain transaction fee earnings from cBridge.

Celer cBridge cross-chain transaction fee earnings come from three sources, the Celer Inter-chain Messaging framework, the open canonical token bridge standard and the pool-based bridge model.

1\. To claim your transaction fee earnings, go to the “My Rewards” page, click “Claim Fee Rewards pool-based bridge” next to “cBridge Transaction Fee”, and a popup will appear to show you the rewards you can claim on different chains.

2.To claim fee rewards on a single chain, click "Claim" next to a single chain.



## Withdraw Your Stakes From SGN

To withdraw your stakes, you need to first unbond your stakes from the delegator, and wait for a 7-day unbonding process. Once stakes are unbonded, they can be withdrawn.

### Unbond Your Stakes

1. To unbond your stakes from a validator, go to "My Rewards" -> "My Delegations", and click the "unbond" button.
